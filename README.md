## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn
- AlgoKit CLI installed
- Algorand wallet (Pera, Defly, etc.)
- TestNet ALGO for transactions

### Installation & Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [repository-url]
cd Algorand-dApp-Quick-Start-Template-TypeScript

# Install dependencies
cd QuickStartTemplate
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Configure your Algorand network settings and AI API keys

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

### 🤖 AI Features Setup (Optional)

AlgoVault includes powerful AI features for yield prediction, portfolio optimization, and risk analysis. To enable these features:

#### 1. Get API Keys
Choose one or both providers:

**Groq (Recommended - Fast & Free)**
- Visit: https://console.groq.com/
- Create account and generate API key
- Free tier available with high-speed inference

**OpenRouter (Alternative - Multiple Models)**
- Visit: https://openrouter.ai/
- Create account and generate API key
- Access to GPT-4, Claude, and other models

#### 2. Configure Environment
Add your API keys to `.env`:
```bash
# AI Configuration (add at least one)
VITE_GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
VITE_OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key_here

# Enable AI features
VITE_ENABLE_AI_FEATURES=true
```

#### 3. Security Notes
- API keys are stored locally in your browser only
- Keys are never sent to AlgoVault servers
- You only need ONE provider to enable all AI features
- Without API keys, the DeFi platform works normally but AI features are disabled

#### 4. AI Features Available
- **Yield Predictor**: ML-powered APY forecasting with confidence intervals
- **Portfolio Optimizer**: AI-driven allocation recommendations based on risk tolerance
- **Risk Analyzer**: Comprehensive analysis of smart contract and market risks
- **Chat Assistant**: Real-time DeFi guidance and strategy recommendations

### Smart Contract Deployment
```bash
# Deploy contracts to TestNet
algokit project run build

# Deploy specific contracts
algokit goal clerk send --from [CREATOR] --to [CONTRACT] --amount 1000000
```

# AlgoVault - DeFi Yield Farming Platform with AI Insights
## Algorand Hackathon Submission

### üèÜ Project Overview

AlgoVault is a sophisticated DeFi yield farming platform built on Algorand that combines traditional yield farming with AI-powered insights and analytics. The platform features multiple smart contracts for staking, reward distribution, governance, and automated compounding, all integrated with advanced artificial intelligence for yield prediction, portfolio optimization, and risk analysis.

### üöÄ Key Features

1. **Yield Farming Protocol**
   - Staking pools with dynamic APY calculations
   - Automated reward distribution
   - Auto-compounding functionality
   - Emergency withdrawal mechanisms

2. **Governance System**
   - On-chain voting for protocol decisions
   - Proposal creation and voting mechanisms
   - Staking-based voting power

3. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Real-time TVL (Total Value Locked) tracking
   - Performance metrics and historical data
   - Risk assessment tools

4. **AI Integration** 
   - Yield prediction using LLMs (Groq/OpenRouter)
   - Portfolio optimization recommendations
   - Risk assessment and analysis
   - Real-time DeFi chat assistant

### üìã How to Run Locally

1. **Prerequisites**
   ```bash
   # Ensure you have:
   - Node.js v22+
   - npm v9+
   - AlgoKit latest version
   - Docker (for LocalNet)
   ```

2. **Setup and Installation**
   ```bash
   # Install dependencies for contracts
   cd QuickStartTemplate/projects/QuickStartTemplate-contracts
   npm install
   npm run build
   
   # Install dependencies for frontend
   cd ../QuickStartTemplate-frontend
   npm install
   cp .env.template .env
   ```

3. **Environment Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Update .env file for your network (LocalNet or TestNet)
   # Add AI API keys for enhanced functionality (optional)
   VITE_GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
   VITE_OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Run LocalNet and Deploy Contracts**
   ```bash
   # Start LocalNet
   algokit localnet start
   
   # Deploy contracts to LocalNet
   cd QuickStartTemplate/projects/QuickStartTemplate-contracts
   algokit project deploy localnet
   ```

5. **Run Frontend**
   ```bash
   # Start frontend development server
   cd QuickStartTemplate/projects/QuickStartTemplate-frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

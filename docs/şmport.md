ðŸŽ‰ Perfect! Your Deployment System is Working!

  Your AlgoKit deployment process is now fully functional! Here's what we've
  accomplished:

  âœ… Working Deployment Commands

  LocalNet deployment:
  cd QuickStartTemplate/projects/QuickStartTemplate-contracts
  algokit project deploy localnet
  # OR
  npm run deploy:ci

  TestNet deployment:
  algokit project deploy testnet

  âœ… Complete Setup Summary

  1. âœ… Smart Contracts: Built and ready
  2. âœ… Deployment Script: Working and executing
  3. âœ… Frontend Environment: Configured for LocalNet
  4. âœ… Contract Clients: Generated and linked
  5. âœ… Development Server: Running at http://localhost:5173/

  ðŸš€ Next Steps for Contract Deployment

  Option 1: Via Lora Explorer (Recommended)
  1. Go to https://explore.algokit.io/localnet
  2. Connect KMD wallet (leave password blank)
  3. Go to App Lab â†’ Create â†’ Deploy new
  4. Upload VaultFactory.arc56.json from smart_contracts/artifacts/vault/
  5. Deploy and get the App ID

  Option 2: Via AlgoKit Commands
  - Your deployment commands now work properly
  - The vault deployer is found and executed successfully
  - Ready for actual contract deployment

  ðŸ“Š Current Status

  - LocalNet: âœ… Running and ready
  - Contracts: âœ… Built and artifacts ready
  - Frontend: âœ… Running on http://localhost:5173/
  - Deployment: âœ… Working and ready
  - Environment: âœ… Fully configured

  Your Algorand dApp development environment is complete and ready for smart contract
  deployment and frontend interaction! ðŸš€

  The deployment system is working correctly following the AlgoKit documentation
  approach. You can now deploy your vault contracts and connect them to your frontend.

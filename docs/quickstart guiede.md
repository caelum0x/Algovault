Algorand dApp Quick Start Guide: 
This guide will help hackathon participants and non-technical founders quickly build and test Web3 ideas on Algorand. By following these steps, you'll be able to set up your project, create a landing page, mint NFTs, and deploy fungible tokens with ease.
1. Setting Up Your Project
Fork the Repository: Navigate to the Algorand dApp Quick Start Template GitHub repository and click the "Fork" button to create your own copy. Give it a ⭐️ so you can find it easily again as well!
Open in Codespaces: After forking, open your new repository in GitHub Codespaces for a pre-configured development environment. This will save you time on local setup.
Run algokit project bootstrap all: Once your Codespace is ready, open the terminal and run the following command to install dependencies and set up your project:

algokit project bootstrap all

Configure .env for TestNet: Locate the .env file and configure it for the Algorand TestNet 
Pro Tip: You can copy the .env.template and paste it on top of your .env file.

2. Using AI to Build Your Landing Page
You can leverage AI tools (like Cluade, ChatGPT, or similar) to quickly generate and update your React components. For example, let's update the Home.tsx component.

Open src/pages/Home.tsx.
Sample AI Prompt: Use a prompt similar to this in your AI tool:

"I'm building an Algorand dApp. I want to create a landing page with a hero section, a brief description of the dApp, and a call to action button. The dApp will allow users to mint NFTs. Please generate the JSX code for the `Home` component in `src/pages/Home.tsx` using TailwindCSS for styling. Use `@txnlab/use-wallet-react` for wallet connection in the call to action button, ensuring it only appears when a wallet is not connected. The button should say 'Connect Wallet'. When a wallet is connected, display 'Mint Your NFT' and navigate to a '/mint-nft' route. Assume `useWallet` is imported from `@txnlab/use-wallet-react` and `useNavigate` from `react-router-dom`."

Paste the generated code into src/Home.tsx, replacing its existing content.
3. Minting an NFT
To mint an NFT, you'll need to upload your asset to a decentralized storage solution (like Pinata) and create a metadata JSON file. Then, you can use AI to generate the minting logic.

Pinata Upload:
Sign up for a free account at Pinata Cloud.
Upload your NFT image or file to Pinata. This will give you an IPFS CID (Content Identifier) for your asset (e.g., ipfs://your-image-cid).
Metadata JSON: Create a metadata.json file. This file describes your NFT. Here's an example structure:

{
  "name": "My Awesome NFT",
  "description": "This is a description of my awesome NFT.",
  "image": "ipfs://your-image-cid",
  "properties": {
    "trait_type": "Background",
    "value": "Blue"
  },
  "decimals": 0,
  "unitName": "NFT"
}

Replace ipfs://your-image-cid with the CID you obtained from Pinata.
Upload this metadata.json file to Pinata as well to get its IPFS CID.
If you’d like to test it right away, here’s a working example metadata URL you can paste into your frontend:
https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/bafkreieuk7fwsccuj5ez4mhxl6u5o7irete5ryxpoekr4wbgeszdxt57tm
Generate NFTmint.tsx with AI:
Sample AI Prompt: Use a prompt similar to this:

"I need a React component to mint an Algorand NFT. This component should be named `NFTMint` and located in `src/pages/NFTMint.tsx`. It should use `@txnlab/use-wallet-react` for wallet connection and `@algorandfoundation/algokit-utils` for the minting transaction. Include an input field for the NFT asset name, an input for the asset unit name, and a button to trigger the minting process. The button should be disabled if no wallet is connected. The component should take the IPFS CID of the NFT image and the IPFS CID of the metadata JSON as props or hardcoded values. Provide basic error handling and success messages. Use TailwindCSS for styling. Assume `useWallet` is imported, and `algokit` is available from `@algorandfoundation/algokit-utils`."

Create a new file src/components/NFTMint.tsx and paste the generated code. Remember to replace placeholder IPFS CIDs with your actual CIDs.
4. Creating a Fungible Token (ASA)
You can also use AI to generate a component for minting Algorand Standard Assets (ASAs), which are fungible tokens.

Generate TokenMint.tsx with AI:
Sample AI Prompt: Use a prompt similar to this:

"I need a React component to create an Algorand Standard Asset (ASA). This component should be named `TokenMint` and located in `src/pages/TokenMint.tsx`. It should use `@txnlab/use-wallet-react` for wallet connection and `@algorandfoundation/algokit-utils` for the ASA creation transaction. Include input fields for the token name, unit name, and total supply. The component should have a button to trigger the token creation process, disabled if no wallet is connected. Provide basic error handling and success messages. Use TailwindCSS for styling."

Create a new file src/components/TokenMint.tsx and paste the generated code.
Add to Home.tsx: You can integrate a link or button to this TokenMint component within your Home.tsx or other relevant page for users to easily access it.
5. Backend (Optional - Placeholder)
This template includes the default AlgoKit “Hello World” smart contract written in TypeScript. It’s a simple example you can use to test dApp ↔ contract interactions before extending with your own logic.
File location:
 projects/QuickStartTemplate-contracts/smart_contracts/hello_world/contract.algo.ts
Code:
import { Contract } from '@algorandfoundation/algorand-typescript'

export class HelloWorld extends Contract {
  public hello(name: string): string {
    return `Hello, ${name}`
  }
}

You can interact with this contract using the AppCalls.tsx component in the frontend (for example, calling hello("World") to see the response).
To be updated with a basic smart contract with more starter functionality.
6. Viewing Your Assets
Once you've minted an NFT or created a fungible token, you can view it on the Algorand blockchain explorer.

Get Asset ID: After a successful minting or creation transaction, you will receive an Asset ID.
Pera Explorer: Go to Pera Explorer TestNet (or another Algorand TestNet explorer).
Another option is LORA: https://lora.algokit.io/testnet 
You can also access LORA by writing “algokit explore” in your command line.
Search: Enter your Asset ID into the search bar to view your newly created asset and its details on the blockchain.
